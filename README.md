Well fuck that!
Why should we learn to type faster with these boring ass texts?

Might as well learn how to enjoy at a deeper level as we type ...

## Develop
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:goldylucks/adamgoldman-typing.git
$ cd adamgoldman-typing
$ yarn
$ yarn start # starts webpack-dev-server on port 8000
```
Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000` and hack away :)
