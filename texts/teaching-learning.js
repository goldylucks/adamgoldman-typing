Change of direction

Tell the person next to you to do something, and have them reply: "Thanks, will do!"
Then have them reply "Will do, thanks!"

Which one do you prefer?
which one sounds better for you?
Which one induces more of a good feeling?

Now hold on to that feeling and close your eyes and as you do so, think of someone who you love, someone that makes you feel good now, and see them looking at you and saying that in just the right way, just the right tone, and notice if the good feeling has begun to spread yet, and what other good feelings begin to grow inside of you.

Now open your eyes and
you, like me, just experienced learning 6 things at once, and a couple of more were delivered a few words ago,
as you try in vain to consciously unravel the layers of information that's been installed within you, just close your eyes for another moment and just feel good.

Ahhh ...

Feel good for no reason ...

Isn't learning fun?

Now here's where the plot thickens.
See, you thought this to be just another training for you.

MUahahahahaha

I got you now folks.
And when you leave here, that's the attitude that will slowly begin to integrate into your teaching.

I want you to look into your future audiences and go ...

"Your ass is MINE"

Just say it in your head, cuz not all audiences are as open as you are, now,
as you teach them, you want to induce good feelings, cuz otherwise, it's your ass that will be theirs.

If you don't make it feel fun to learn things, it won't!
And the more you can feel good within you, the more you can induce, the more THEY will want to access the information,
because you have to remember, it's not about you, it's about them, and that makes it even more about you ...

You can feel good for no reason, and you can try in vain to not feel good for no reason, but your unconscious doesn't process negation, and the more you try to not think of blue or green and not feel good, the more you will, now ...!

The trick is to load the conscious mind, the monkey brain that yackes and yackes, so you can install things directly to your other mind,
now, there are two more pieces before we begin to put your brain back together, so I want you, for a moment, to just sit like you are sitting now, and close eyes and see again the person who makes you feel good, looking at you and saying the same thing, and as the good feeling gets stronger now
open your eyes, and you, like me ...

(point to self)

Induce desire, point to self!

Pretty sneaky hah?

Not something I picked up in Rapport 101 ;)

And we're about to go into the last piece, but you guys seem like you need a moment, unless ...
of course ...

Unelss you want to proceed?

You sure?

Maybe we should slow things down?

Oh I know ... You guys seem like the serious kind.
What we need is some charts!

Oh yes.
Here we go.

So the X axis is you feeling good,
and the Y is you learning.

Oh and here's another one here's another one.

X is how strong the "WTF" you hear is going,
Y is how deep the good feeling of how you learn now integrates with more and more areas of your life



X: HEEEEE
Y: Haaaaaaa


U don't want to chunk down the information?



If, in a somewhat magical way, the winning lottery numbers


Close your eye for a moment and recall the last time someone

Isn't it weird?

Same content. Same person.

Now this is snkeaky, notice I ask (twice) for you to compare between the two.
